# Bioinformatics-Tools-Repository
>Collection of bioinformatic tools to work with fastq format, gbk, DNA and RNA sequences, protein sequences, and more.

This is the result of homeworks during the 2-semester bioinformatics course. The main topic cowered are Object-Oriented programming, function writing, API, web page parsing, decorators, testing, and paralleling. 

⭐
Document **Showcases** presents the main examples of usage of some of the tools. 

📁
Document **bio files processor** provides functions to work with fasta files.

👩‍💻
Document **bioinformatics tool** defines important classes such as DNASequence, RNASequence, AminoAcidSequence. Additionally allows filtering fasta files, runs genscan and parse results, and defines decorator *telegram logger*.

🧬
Document **additional modules** provides simple functions such as reverse, transcribe, and complement of sequences, some functions to work with peptides. 

🌲⚟
Document **custom random forest** shows an example of how to use threads to make custom random forest fit and prediction execute faster.

🧪
Document **test bioinformatics tools** provides automatic tests for the main parts of this repository functionality.
